# HERE SBT BOM plugin

## Introduction
The HERE platform SBT BOM plugin provides a way to use Maven [BOM (bill of materials)](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#bill-of-materials-bom-poms) in SBT projects.
The plugin features importing multiple BOM files to use as a source of dependency versions, automatically processing parent and dependent BOMs.

## Limitation
The HERE platform SBT BOM plugin is provided "as is" and is not officially a part of HERE Workspace or HERE Marketplace.
While there is no official support by HERE, you may still raise issues via GitHub. We may be able to help.

## Prerequisites
This plugin is compatible with:
- Scala 2.12
- sbt 1.3.0 or newer

## How to use it
The following text provides a step-by-step guide on how to import [Jackson BOM](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-bom) into an sbt project.

### Load the plugin

Add the `sbt-bom` plugin to `plugins.sbt` file.
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.here.platform" % "sbt-bom" % "1.0.7")
```

If you're encountering issues or using earlier versions, you might have to explicitly declare the Maven Central repository:
```scala
resolvers += Resolver.url(
  "MAVEN_CENTRAL",
  url("https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2"))(
  Patterns("[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision](-[classifier]).[ext]") )
```
This will enable the project to access plugin files stored in Maven Central, https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/here/platform/sbt-bom_2.12_1.0/.

### Read & use a BOM

#### In a `dependencyOverrides` context

If you want to get all the dependencies declared in the BOM and use their version to override yours, follow this step.
If you're looking for more control, go to the [general context](#in-a-general-context) section below.

Add BOM dependency to the `build.sbt`:
```scala
import com.here.bom.Bom
lazy val jacksonDependencies = Bom.dependencies("com.fasterxml.jackson" % "jackson-bom" % "2.14.2")
```

This creates an sbt `Setting` that resolves the list of `ModuleID` declared in a desired BOM.

Enable this setting in the module configuration and use this setting in `dependencyOverrides`:
```scala
lazy val `demo` = project
  .in(file("."))
  .settings(jacksonDependencies)
  .settings(
    dependencyOverrides ++= jacksonDependencies.key.value
  )
```

#### In a general context

Add BOM dependency to the `build.sbt`:
```scala
import com.here.bom.Bom
lazy val jacksonBom = Bom.read("com.fasterxml.jackson" % "jackson-bom" % "2.14.2")(bom => Dependencies(bom))
```

This creates an sbt `Setting` that resolves a desired BOM, creates a `Bom` object from it and then builds a `Dependencies` object.
Under the `project` directory, create a `Dependencies` class that takes a `Bom` as a constructor parameter.
Inside this class, we can refer to the versions from the BOM.
The class should expose a list of dependencies that used as `libraryDependencies`
```scala
import sbt._
import com.here.bom.Bom

case class Dependencies(bom: Bom) {
  val dependencies: Seq[ModuleID] = Seq(
    "com.fasterxml.jackson.core" % "jackson-databind" % bom
  )
  
  // Note: you may also use bom.bomDependencies which gives you the list of all dependencies declared in the BOM.
  // This gives the same result as Bom.dependencies (see above).
}
```

Enable this setting in the module configuration and use this setting in `libraryDependencies`:
```scala
lazy val `demo` = project
  .in(file("."))
  .settings(jacksonBom)
  .settings(
    libraryDependencies ++= jacksonBom.key.value.dependencies
  )
```

### Password-protected repositories
The following text explains how to access password-protected repositories, specifically the HERE platform repository,
using a file with credentials.

For accessing password-protected repositories, such as the HERE platform repository, you need to create a file with credentials at `~/.sbt/.credentials`
with the following content:
```
realm=Artifactory Realm
host=repo.platform.here.com
user=<your used id>
password=<top secret password>
```
The user name and password can be retrieved as described in the [Get your repository credentials tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/here-workspace-developer-guide-java-scala/page/topics/get-credentials.html#get-your-repository-credentials).

Then include the credentials in `build.sbt` file:
```sbt
project.settings(
  credentials += Credentials(Path.userHome / ".sbt" / ".credentials")
)
```
and include the HERE platform repository resolver:
```sbt
ThisBuild / resolvers += (
  "HERE Platform Repository" at "https://repo.platform.here.com/artifactory/open-location-platform"
)
```
Now the project is configured to use BOM files from a password-protected repository. For example, [`sdk-batch-bom`](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/here-workspace-developer-guide-java-scala/page/sdk-libraries.html#sdk-libraries-for-batch-primary) can be used.
```sbt
lazy val sdkBom = Bom.read("com.here.platform" %% "sdk-batch-bom" % "2.57.3")(bom => Dependencies(bom))
```

The credentials can be supplied through these methods, with the following precedence:
1. By passing the command line parameter `-Dsbt.boot.credentials=<file>`.
2. Via the environment variable `SBT_CREDENTIALS=<file>`.
3. By creating the file `~/.sbt/.credentials` in your home directory.
4. By creating the file `~/.ivy2/.credentials` in your home directory.
